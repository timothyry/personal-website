# personal-website
This repository contains the code running at my personal website www.tremmerich.com. It's driven primarily by Sinatra and takes advantange of Slim templates. Sinatra is probably overkill for the scope of the website, but I wanted experience using the DSL, and it gives me the option of adding interesting API calls in Ruby (for social media integration, etc) on-the-fly at a future date. It's also a lighter-weight alternative to a full-blown RoR project.
## Getting Started
The website was purposely designed to be light-wight. Requires Ruby and Bundler. Running the following command will install all necessary Ruby gems:

```
bundle install
```


## Built With
* [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) - web framework (DSL)
* [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) - templating engine

## Live Demo
